# RNN
Replicator Neural Network WEKA Package

Class for building and using a classifier built on the Replicator Neural Network anomaly detection algorithm. Note that this classifier is designed for anomaly detection, it is not designed for solving two-class or multi-class classification problems! For more information see HAWKINS, S.; HE, H.; WILLIAMS, G.; BAXTER, R. Outlier detection using replicator neural networks. Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (2002), 170-180. See also: DAU, H. A.; CIESIELSKI, V.; SONG, A. Anomaly detection using replicator neural networks trained on examples of one class. In Asia-Pacific Conference on Simulated Evolution and Learning (2014), Springer, pp. 311-322.

To simple install, just download the https://github.com/f1lipe/RNN/blob/master/ReplicatorNeuralNetwork/dist/ReplicatorNeuralNetwork.zip , open Weka > Tools Menu > Package Manager and select the downloaded file. The new package will be available at misc classifier folder.
